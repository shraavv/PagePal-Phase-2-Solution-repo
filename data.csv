As You Like It,William Shakespeare,"As You Like It has sometimes seemed a subversive play that exposes the instability of gender roles and traditional values. In other eras it has been prized - or derided - as a reliable celebration of conventional social mores. The play's ability to compass these extremes tells an interesting story about changing cultural and theatrical practices. This edition provides a detailed history of the play in production, both on stage and on screen. The introduction examines how changing conceptions of gender roles have affected the portrayal of Rosalind, one of Shakespeare's greatest comic heroines. The striking differences between the British tradition and the freer treatment the play has received abroad are discussed, as well as the politics of court versus country. The commentary, printed alongside the New Cambridge edition of the text, draws on primary sources to illuminate how costuming, stage business, design, and directorial choices have shaped the play in performance.",2004-05-31,en,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=xHZl0yC8B90C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:comedy&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api
Cyrano de Bergerac,Edmond Rostand,"One of the most beloved heroes of the stage, Cyrano de Bergerac is a magnificent wit who, despite his many gifts, feels that no woman can ever love him because of his enormous nose. He adores the beautiful Roxanne but, lacking courage, decides instead to help the tongue-tied but winsome Christian woo the fair lady by providing him with flowery sentiments and soulful poetry. Roxanne is smitten-but is it Christian she loves or Cyrano? A triumph from the moment of its 1897 premiere, Cyrano de Bergerac has become one of the most frequently produced plays in the world. Its perennial popularity is a tribute to the universal appeal of its themes and characters.",1899,en,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=1crxAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:comedy&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api

Much Ado about Nothing,William Shakespeare,"This is the first edition of Much Ado About Nothing to focus wholly on the play in performance. John Cox investigates major issues and trends in the production of this popular work, analysing successive reinterpretations of the play in relation to their cultural and ideological contexts. Gender issues are central to the study, which highlights in striking ways the changing constructions of womanhood in performances from Shakespeare's time to the present. A commentary alongside the New Cambridge Shakespeare edition of the text recreates in lively detail interpretations of each passage in a variety of British, American, Canadian and other productions, including film and television versions. A full introduction also examines the problematic relation of dark and comic elements in a wide range of performances. An essential resource for students, teachers, actors and directors, this is an illuminating book for all theatregoers. -- from Publisher's Description.",1997,en,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=XwLFDBmVO20C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:comedy&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api
Every Man Out of His Humour,Ben Jonson,"Jonson's Every Man Out of His Humour is a comical satire about envy and aspiration among the ambitious middle classes, who seek happiness in fame and material fortune. This first critical edition of the play conveys early modern obsessions with wealth and self-display through historical contexts. The book offers an intriguing look at the course of urban comedy, and a wealth of information about social relationships and colloquial language at the end of the Elizabethan period.",2001,en,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=eFoj4IhKlWsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:comedy&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api

As You Like it,"Penny Gay, William Shakespeare","One of the best loved of Shakespeare's 'middle comedies', As You Like It has rarely been out of the theatrical repertoire. Centering on the cross-dressed figure of Rosalind, the play both celebrates and questions the state of being in love. This study attempts to recreate the Elizabethan audience's experience of the play - its awareness of issues that have been elided in subsequent, simply 'romantic' readings. Using an innovative theory of the significance of the Globe's stage space, Penny Gay examines the play's presentation of issues of power, sexuality, gender and genre.",1999,en,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=b0ZvDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:comedy&hl=&cd=14&source=gbs_api
